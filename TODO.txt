BUGS!
- When a wrong value is entered, it changes the name but it doesn't update the temperature,
so it is unclear if it has found it or not
   - Erase old info
   - Configure an error


EXTRA
- add a language chooser
- Have the date more nicely done



---> DONE!
- Input text doesn't empty after submit
